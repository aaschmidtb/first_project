        <H1>A <u>REALLY</u> Bad Story.</H1>
        <H2>It was friday the 13th, the night before Halloween,</H2>
    
        <p> And that day was a day. Not a like a day that seems endless, and not like a day that seems too short. 
            The only way to describe this day is like the personification of eating oranges after brushing your teeth.
        It was just <i>UUUUUUUUGH</i>.</p>
